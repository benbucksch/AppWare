Platform as a service

The idea of appware has obviously been replaced by 

What is "Internet" AppWare and how is it different than the version of AppWare as described from 1993.

Intel XDK (similar concept, and on NodeWebkit)

priorities:

windows app builder "precompiler" out

NOT for deployment

pinpoint known bugs

recompile on Win8?

iconography?

Most important part -- get the codebase running on Win 8

IOS and Android

Joe, "I want to open source it"

application OS

disolve the difference between "domain" and apps

First thing to Open Source

keep the "shell" closed source until ready, but open source the object libraries

UniNav? similarly ambitious concept for being able to visually explore virtually any database
organizing information entities into taxonomy
user relationship
risomatic?
relational

conceptual relationships???

purist version of the hyperlink idea (!?!?!)
