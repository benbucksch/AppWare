AppWare is a combination of an MVC and a virtual machine.

Appware provides native compilation for minimalistic, high performance native-like applications.

AppWare is intended to be a bridge between native, mobile and web environments.

visual programming

hybrid native/mobile/web apps


<!-- ******************************** -->

There are some concepts of the "MVC/VM" idea that need significantly different 

###Description - What is AppWare

Visual Programming interface to native application building

--- or webapp building???
--- mobile app building???

interface to Cocoa headers in Obj-C
interface to Windows headers in C++

perhaps use Node.js to glue everything together?
	but we would end up using C++ to glue the Obj-C into the Node.js layer anyway

--- platform agnostic "native" like headers
--- this part needs to be started from the ground up; we can't depend on 20 year old DOS and early windows files for a platform agnostic experience
--- how much functionality of the native headers it necessary to encapsulate?

--- make it modular
		seperate the object libraries from the application


front end building:

cross-platform front end in Node.js or front end built in AppWare itself?

--- scripting language functionality?


platform agnostic back-end options:
	Node.js
	Qt











Platform as a service

The idea of appware has obviously been replaced by 

What is "Internet" AppWare and how is it different than the version of AppWare as described from 1993.

Intel XDK (similar concept, and on NodeWebkit)

priorities:

windows app builder "precompiler" out

NOT for deployment


<!-- 
disolve the difference between "domain" and apps

First thing to Open Source

keep the "shell" closed source until ready, but open source the object libraries

UniNav? similarly ambitious concept for being able to visually explore virtually any database
organizing information entities into taxonomy
user relationship
risomatic?
relational

conceptual relationships???

purist version of the hyperlink idea (!?!?!)
