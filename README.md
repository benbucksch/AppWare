AppWare
=======

###Description

AppWare is in early stage of its development lifecycle, so any description given here may be in a constant state of flux.  Likewise the codebase will be subject to many breaking changes throughout its development.

###Compilation

######Windows

To compile the legacy AppWare from source, run the batch file ```./src/appwre32/build/src/maketool.bat``` to create a makefile.

Build dependencies for Windows are Visual C++ and MFC2.0. Legacy Appware also depends on numerous old windows headers such as 'dos.h'. These will hopefully all be removed in future iterations.
