This help file was generated using the Help file utility "Help Breeze". 
The text of the document was converted from PageMaker on the Macintosh 
over to a Windows Word document. There is no single-point-of-control for
this information.  As of 7/26/94 the documents are essentially identical, 
however there is no gracefull way to merge changes from the Pagemaker Doc.
From 7/26/94 on, changes to the help file or to the hardcopy documentation
in Pagemaker are not reflected in the other document.

The following manual process was followed in order to convert the document 
into a help file:

IN PAGEMAKER (MAC)
1) Print a hardcopy of the original document section
2) Open a new (empty) document in PageMaker.
3) Place the Pagemaker document section into the blank document.
		Select "all" stories in the original document
		Turn off Autoflow
		Place the document... all into a single story
4) Edit the newly created story in the new document
5) Export the new story in MS Word format (Mac Version)

IN MS WORD (MAC)
6) Edit the newly created Word Document and save it out (this is necessary
   because the MAC MS Word file created by Pagemaker cannot be read by MS Word
   on Windows

IN MS WORD 2.0 (WINDOWS)
7) Compare the paragraphs imported from pagemaker into windows against the 
   Pagemaker print-out.  The paragraphs are stored in the order created in 
   Pagemaker, not in the order shown in the printed document.
8) Re-format as necessary to allign paragraphs as in hardcopy. The "SDK" 
   template can be used to somewhat standardize the paragraph styles.
9) Change the template to HLPBRZ to begin using Help Breeze
